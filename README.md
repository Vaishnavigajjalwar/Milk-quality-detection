# Milk-quality-detection
I have check  the milk quality by  using Logistic Regression. 
Milk quality detection is the process of determining the level of purity and freshness of milk. I have used various parameters from data which are Ph level, turbidity, fat, taste, colour, odour.
For the model prediction I used Logistic Regression. In Milk Quality Detection, logistic regression can be used to predict whether a sample of milk is of good quality or not, based on the values of various independent variables, such as fat, colour, grade, taste.
I did a Exploratory  data analysis (EDA) by using matplotlib, seaborn for the visualization of Milk quality.
Then my model predict with the accuracy of Precision: 0.6999090380100728
Recall: 0.7169811320754716
F1 Score: 0.6993923888711224.
